Example: https://github.com/r-lib/gh\n\nThe URL in (2) must be the true and authentic GitHub/GitLab location of the package according to its owners, or an active mirror of the true location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites for packages\n\n\n\n\nThe package source code must exist in a public GitHub or GitLab repository with the DESCRIPTION file at the root of the project. Example: https://github.com/r-lib/gh.\nThe repository must host a GitHub release or GitLab release for the latest version intended for distribution. Example: https://github.com/r-lib/gh/releases/tag/v1.4.0. Pre-releases (GitHub) and upcoming releases (GitLab) are ignored to ensure each release has the full endorsement of its maintainer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages in a GitHub repo subdirectory\n\n\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, the package may be in a subdirectory of a GitHub repo. In these cases, your text file may instead contain a JSON list with fields package, url, subdir, and branch, and the branch field must be \"*release\". Example:\n{\n  \"package\": \"paws.analytics\",\n  \"url\": \"https://github.com/paws-r/paws\",\n  \"subdir\": \"cran/paws.analytics\",\n  \"branch\": \"*release\"\n}"

    "text": "The manual review process\nIf a pull request is flagged for manual review, an R-multiverse moderator will read the pull request and ask questions if necessary. Although the moderator may make optional suggestions on a case-by-case basis, package reviews must be consistent, reliable, and inclusive whenever possible. The decision to close or merge the pull request must be based exclusively on the following pre-defined list of requirements:\n\nEach contribution must comply with the code of conduct. Examples of prohibited content include profanity, malicious behavior, security risks, copyright violations, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. All this applies to the package, the URL, any other metadata in the contribution, and the contents of the package itself.\nThe package name, URL, and all other metadata must be complete and correct.\nEach text file must apply to only one package.\nThe text file name must be the name of the package.\nFor JSON listings, the \"branch\" field must be \"*release\" (except in specific predetermined cases such as packages in https://github.com/cran), the \"subdirectory\" field must be supplied and exist, the \"url\" field must exist and be correct, and the \"package\" field must agree with the name of the text file.\nEach contributed URL must point to an existing GitHub or GitLab repository.\nThe URL must be the true/official location of the source code or a faithful mirror of the true location. The package maintainers have the authority to choose the URL. Unofficial or unsupported forks should not be included. The moderator must use discretion on a case-by-case basis because sometimes a fork becomes the true version (e.g. if the original maintainer abandons a package and becomes unreachable indefinitely).\nThe URL must have a release on GitHub or GitLab so R-universe can process the package without error. As a last resort, if the maintainer does not provide their own releases, a repository from the CRAN mirror at https://github.com/cran may be registered.\nIf the listing of an existing package is modified, then the moderator must verify that the new information is complete and correct. In many cases, it may be necessary to obtain permission from the package maintainer.\nThe reasons for deleting a package listing may vary on a case-by-case basis. The moderator must carefully consider the impact that deletion would have on the community and on reverse dependencies. In many cases, it may be necessary to obtain permission from the package maintainer."

The use of this private repository ensures that even confidential conversations remain accountable and auditable.\nPrivate mailing lists are not used by the project.\n\n\nR-Multiverse Management Committee (RMC)\nThe R-Multiverse Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for the active management of the R-Multiverse project. The main role of the RMC is to further the long-term development and health of the community as a whole, and to ensure that balanced and broad-based user engagement and contributor participation takes place.\nAs part of this, the RMC is the sole proposer and approver of changes to this governance document and all policies regarding operation of the r-multiverse GitHub repositories.\nThe RMC collectively appoint and delegate authority to moderators to perform a limited subset of duties.\nThe RMC is responsible for protecting the R-Multiverse name, brand and reputation, and for enforcing adherence to this document.\nWhere this is jeopardised through the actions of an Administrator, Moderator or Contributor, the RMC will have the authority to immediately remove that person from their capacity in that role, not requiring the usual one month notice period for enacting Proposals.\n\n\nChanges to the RMC\nProposals to add or remove members of the RMC shall be put forward publicly by any member of the RMC, and shall be treated in the same way as any other Proposal, as described below.\n\n\nProposals\nAll changes to this governance document, or to a policy document such as the Code of Conduct or Review Policy that governs how the repositories operate will be posted for comment at the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. All members of the community are invited to participate, and Proposals may be withdrawn or revised by their initial proposer as a result. Revisions likely to be regarded as material shall be proposed as a new Proposal, with reference to the preceding discussion.\nProposals will be deemed to have been adopted if both one calendar month has passed after notice has been publicly posted and either (i) there has been no dissent from from an administrator or (ii) dissent by an administrator was recorded and the Proposal has been passed after voting has taken place as per the Voting Process described below.\n\n\nVoting Process\nDecision-making is by consensus of the RMC as far as possible. All policy changes, including changes to this document, shall be posted publicly to the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. If there is no dissent by another administrator, the Proposal comes into effect one calendar month after it is posted.\nIf there is dissent by an administrator, they should post a reasoned reply within the one calendar month notice period. However, no one administrator has a veto. Where there is dissent, voting shall take place among administrators to decide on an issue, with a simple majority of votes required for a Proposal to pass.\nAs illustration, if the total number of administrators is six, then at least four votes are required to pass a Proposal.\nIf a Proposal is passed, it will come into effect one calendar month after the Proposal was initially posted. If a Proposal is not passed within one calendar month of the posting of the Proposal, then the Proposal lapses and is not enacted until such a time that it passes.\nVoting shall take place publicly under the same Proposal that was initially posted."

Issues may include (but are not limited to):\n\nUnauthorized access to https://github.com/r-multiverse or its repositories.\nMalicious attempts to inundate https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions/pulls with pull requests.\nOther denial of service (DoS) attacks on the R-multiverse bot or other infrastructure.\n\nPlease help keep R-multiverse operational. In the event of publicly visible malicious behavior, such as a DoS attack on https://github.com/r-multiverse/contributions/pulls, please:\n\nReport abuse or spam through GitHub.\nOpen an issue at https://github.com/r-multiverse/help to inform R-multiverse administrators.\n\nIf you notice a vulnerability that an attacker could potentially exploit, please report it privately. Confidentiality helps fix the problem before most attackers even know about it. After remediation, R-multiverse administrators will open an issue at https://github.com/r-multiverse/help to inform community about the vulnerability and its resolution.\nThe steps to privately report vulnerabilities are:\n\nNavigate to https://github.com/r-multiverse/help/security.\nUnder “Private vulnerability reporting”, click “Report a vulnerability”.\nDescribe the issue in the advisory details form.\nAt the bottom, click “Submit report”. GitHub will then add you as a collaborator on the proposed security advisory you created."

    "text": "What does R-multiverse provide?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. A home for non-CRAN packages\n\n\n\n\n\nMany R packages do not belong on CRAN. In particular, packages containing compiled code may require toolchains or binary downloads that fall outside of CRAN policy.\nBy contributing a package to R-multiverse, you may conveniently install the latest released versions of all these packages from a single repository location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. A guarantee of package availability\n\n\n\n\n\nR-multiverse works seamlessly alongside CRAN.\nA package may become unavailable on CRAN at any time due to its strict archival policy.\n\nSometimes due to the archival of a dependency, and outside the maintainer’s direct control.\nSituations can be temporary, but may take an extended time to resolve.\n\nBy contributing a package that you rely on, you can ensure it always remains available for your critical workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. A distribution channel direct from maintainers\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintainers may use R-multiverse as a faster release channel, especially for packages under intensive development.\nCRAN is first and foremost an archival network, and its policy restricts the frequency of package updates. R-multiverse allows maintainers to push critical updates or bug fixes directly to users."
